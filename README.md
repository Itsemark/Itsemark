Welcome! My name is e.mark and I'm from Hungary. Currently I'm the owner of the Transit Guide project. I'm a self taught passionate c# programmer and my mission is to make safe, stabile code. I have more than 3 years of coding experience.

About the Transit Guide project...

...It is all about mobility:

Our mission is to deliver a complex realtime gps-based public transportation tracking service with schedule planning feature and much more!
Our on-board unit is capable of realtime passanger informing via displays and audio.
Our project includes a dispatch system with fleet manager in order to make transportation as seamless as possible.

Thank you for the attention! Hope you have a wonderful day! :)
